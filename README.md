# RepeatFinder
A python package to quickly find repeats in a DNA sequence

Get, compile, and then install the module
```
git clone https://github.com/deprekate/RepeatFinder
cd RepeatFinder
python3 setup.py install --user
```

Import and use the module as normal
```
import repeatfinder as rf
my_reps = rf.get_repeats('GGGGGGGGGGGGcAAAAAAAAAAAAgctacgatggagctgacGGGGGGGGGGGGtAAAAAAAAAAAAt')
```

You can even allow for gaps in the repeats by using the keyword `gap`
```
my_reps = rf.get_repeats('GGGGGGGGGGGGcAAAAAAAAAAAAgctacgatggagctgacGGGGGGGGGGGGtAAAAAAAAAAAAt', gap = 1)
```
The return values are an iterable list containing four-tuples, where the first and second tuple correspond to the coordinates
of one of the repeat pairs, and the third and fourth correspond to the other repeat.  The list is sorted with the higher scoring
repeat pairs coming first.

To run the example script:
```
python3 test.py
```
and the output would be the following
```
non gapped repeats
(1, 12, 43, 54)
(1, 11, 44, 54)
(2, 12, 43, 53)
(14, 25, 56, 67)
(14, 24, 57, 67)
(15, 25, 56, 66)
gapped repeats
(1, 25, 43, 67)
(1, 11, 44, 54)
(2, 12, 43, 53)
(14, 24, 57, 67)
(15, 25, 56, 66)
```
